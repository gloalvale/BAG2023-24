Stop the genocide of my people Stop the ethnic cleansing of my people Stop the occupation of my people Stop the dehumanization of my people Stop the justification of murder of thousands of children Free Palestine #FreePalestine #CeasefireNOW
The players didn't have a chance to play the game with the draft which stings the most - there was no room to show any adjustments we made from minute 1. We can only be pragmatic and do everything we can to win 3 games straight. Nothing else to say or do. Thank you for the support, we haven't shown it in the games but it means the world to us. Til next week. #KCORP #KCWIN #KCORPWIN
It is on me that we have not pieced together a solid foundation to close out any position, we need time and for winter split we do not have any. We must remain resilient and find the solutions overnight. Thank you for your love and support, we put down our heads and continue to work and plan for tomorrow. #KCWIN #KCORP
Backs against the wall, happens eventually in every season, not the way we wanted to but that's the situation we've put ourselves in. Don't need to say more, we need to show more. Thank you for your continued support, we will keep working hard to give you the showings you deserve. #KCWIN #KCORPWIN #KCORP
The sun shines bright #KCWIN #KCORPWIN #KCORP
Back day for big carries tomorrow #KCORP #KCORPWIN #KCWIN

"Thank you to all who supported the fundraiser from me and 
@NotDonJake
 - We raised 6776 euro! 

I will continue to think of ways to support the people in need on the ground in Gaza, for now I will continue to make my voice heard regarding the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing 

80% of the global famine is in Gaza, no medical supplies, no water and no shelter due to the ongoing bombing and killing of innocents

Thank you once again to all of you who shared and participated

The winners have been emailed by Don Jake"

"I own the losses and what comes with it, we were the worse team today and that is on me.

We put in the work but came through with too much imprecision. We will keep working hard and we will realign our efforts to be more in tune with what is required. We are capable of more. 

We have to and will prove ourselves. The sun will shine again.

"Let's make this clear: We all love Kameto and Karmine Corp, it's synonymous. Ibai has a very successful brand and stream, but to equate KOI to KC is pure delusion.
KOI was in LEC, no energy in the arena, no impact 
0 eumasters
Who are the KOI legends? What is KOI league of legends history?
Karmine Corp and KOI is NOT the same. 

They have a chance to learn from what KC has done or worst case they can go and put their brand on the next LEC team."
"I feel bad for MAD, they play versus us at the worst time for them. We are rejuvenated, hungry, ready and excited to introduce Elyoya to a little taste of what his teammates went through last year. 

Blue wall, stand tall

"Experience is only that if you extract what is useful from what you go through - the results are tough and the games can be won, but these are the things that we must iron out to be fully unleashed. It will take effort and we are gonna keep giving it all. We need to keep the perspective that the most important thing is to become stronger and more resiliant. When we play our final game this winter split the accumlation of what we have learnt and where we put our effort is the only thing that will count. 

GG well played 
@G2esports
 - Always a pleasure

Thank you for your continued support, always and forever #KCWIN #KCORP"
"I hope G2 bring their absolute best, I want our victory to be as delicious as possible. We prepared a bullet with their name on it.

"Fnatic was the more disciplined team today and their experience as a group showed - we have some rough edges to iron out and we will work hard to extract all we can and perform better coming into tomorrow

Keep giving us your energy brothers and sisters #KCORP #KCWIN"

"I am doing a raffle fundraiser with 
@NotDonJake
 - all funds go to UN Crisis Relief (Occupied Palestinian Territory Humanitarian Fund), a non-profit charity helping the humanitarian crisis on the ground in Gaza

Each 5 € euro donated grants a ticket for the prizes (more tickets bought higher chance of winning): 
- Gucci Suit, worn at the world championship 2021 (see photo)
- Football signed by TheShy, Ruler, Bwipo, Nemesis and LS

The people of Palestine are in desperate need of our help. They are facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the ongoing conflict has left countless families homeless, injured and without access to basic necessities (food, energy, water, shelter).

Our goal is to use our voice to help rally help for those in need. Retweets are greatly appreciated.
