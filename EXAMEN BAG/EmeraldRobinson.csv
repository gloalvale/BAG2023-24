The pandemic is to force you to get the vaccine. The vaccine is to force you to get the vaccine passport. The vaccine passport is to force you into the social credit system. The social credit system is to force you into obeying the government.
The leaked audio of the GOP Chairman of Arizona trying to bribe Kari Lake is an important historical document which proves beyond all doubt that high-ranking party members are installed through corruption, and fear being murdered if they conduct themselves honestly.
Some people think that God doesn't exist but just look at all the godless communists who have been fired from the LA Times, TIME, Sports Illustrated, Business Insider, Forbes, Conde Nast and Daily News! Journalism is healing.
Farewell to 10% of the staff at Business Insider who just got laid off. Couldn't happen to a more deserving group of frauds and liars!
When Eric Holder defies Congress: no problem. When Peter Navarro defies Congress: jail. When Hunter Biden defies Congress: no problem. When Steve Bannon defies Congress: jail. See how this works?
"It annoys me when corporate media whores say that I spread ""misinformation about COVID vaccines."" That's an outrageous lie: I have never said they were ""safe and effective."" Not once."
Breaking: Jeff Dewit has resigned as Arizona GOP Chairman after audio was leaked of his attempt to bribe Kari Lake to refrain from running for the U.S. Senate.
Christianity is a conquering ideology. It promises that every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. You can serve only one master. You cannot serve the rainbow flag or woke socialism or Mammon and still serve Christ.
"“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."" -Matthew 10:34"
That awkward silence in America right now are all the vaccinated people realizing that Pfizer tested its COVID vaccine on a couple of rats and then allowed pregnant women to take it.
Already saying goodbye in 2024: Sports Illustrated, Nikki Haley, the Los Angeles Times, door bolts on Boeing airplanes, the Supreme Court's last shred of credibility, the drag queen CEO of United Airlines, COVID vaccine maniac Mike Dickson, and every lawnmower in California!
Farewell to the communist hordes getting laid off today at the Los Angeles Times! Learn to code.
Congratulations to the GOP Chairman of Arizona for being caught on audio admitting to Kari Lake that, if he went public with the corruption of high-ranking party members, he would likely be murdered by a car bomb.
Looks like @GavinNewsom gave a secret bioweapons lab run by Chinese communists some kind of tax credit! There's a word for this kind of thing: treason.
You need to be clear-eyed about the state of America now. The Constitution doesn’t exist. The Bill of Rights? It’s gone. A fair trial? Where do you live? The FBI is infiltrating churches and protecting pedophiles. The hour is very late.
Even liberals are waking up to the reality that Obama is a total fraud who can't release his college records or his college letters or anything else because he's a gay communist from Kenya.
"Obama told his college girlfriend in a letter: ""You see, I make love to men daily, but in the imagination.”"
"The liberal Obama biographer's summation of Barack Obama is damning:""He’s not normal—as in not a normal politician or a normal human being."""
"America's republic is ""dying"" in the sense that ordinary Americans no longer believe America's republic exists. And they are right. We live in an empire ruled by the Pentagon and the CIA and the FBI."
America's national security state has been caught deliberately undermining our elections.
According to the Supreme Court, the state of Texas doesn't really have any rights. According to the Supreme Court, the Constitution doesn't really exist. Wake up. The hour is much later than you think.
The people who wanted vaccine passports two years ago are the same people who now allow illegal aliens to board airplanes without ID all across America.
Good morning to everyone - except @BretBaier who sold himself out to Democrats in 2020 when he called Arizona early for Biden with 1% of precincts reporting. Never forget the traitors at @FoxNews.
The credibility of the Supreme Court is gone. The credibility of the GOP House is gone. The credibility of the GOP Senate was gone awhile ago. The credibility of the RNC has been gone for decades. The GOP exists now in name only.
It's time for a total and complete shutdown of the Federalist Society until our country's conservatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
Good point.
"The GOP spent the last THREE YEARS telling you on cable news every day: there's a massive border invasion run by the Biden regime. It's the GOP's main issue. ""Conservative"" Supreme Court judges just voted to ALLOW THE INVASION. Can't think of a way to enrage GOP voters more."
"RIP: the myth of the ""conservative"" Supreme Court."
"Over-the-hill GOP influencers keep telling you the Supreme Court is ""conservative"" but those frauds just sided with the Biden regime against Texas in the border ""razor wire"" case. Apparently, our states don't have any rights."
"The voting machines in Arizona are flipping registered Republican voters to ""independent"" status right before the primary - but you still think you're going to vote the Biden regime out of office in 2024?"
