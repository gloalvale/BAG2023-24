the “A” in her name stands for always overthinking
i feel so detached from people after i remove myself from them... it feels like whatever relationship we ever had didn’t even happen and whenever I think about it, it feels fake. like it was a dream or something. what is that??
no offense to me but why do i feel so tired, exhausted, and drained
don't let them fuck up your peace just cause they can't find theirs.
she’s a 10 but she cries when she’s mad
so sick of going through the same shit over and over again
moving fast isn’t the goal. moving correctly is.
i want to meet myself from someone else’s point of view
one thing about me…. if you genuinely believe cutting me off helps & improves your life in anyway, i support it…but understand , that once you do it , it goes both ways & it is for LIFE. i won’t allow you to pick & choose when i exist to you. once it’s done..it’s done.
a relationship where you don’t have to beg for time, attention, or love >>>
i hate getting attached because letting go is the hardest thing to do
crazy how a song can take you back to a specific time in your life
i appreciate the small shit cuz i’m usually the giver
putting your phone on dnd & ignoring the whole world is self care
i hate liking someone i be losing my fucking mind
when i feel ignored, i distance myself
it’s okay to let friendships die
i hate loud noise but i love loud music
a heart like mine don't come around twice
everything hits you at night
unsaid thoughts are literally the heaviest shit ever
ignore me and i’ll do the same
it's crazy how fast everything can change
i hate second chances, people never change
life is so much better with money and good outfits
as much as i wanted that bond, idc bout it no more. be safe. do you
You want a relationship to work but you have to be willing to learn how a person needs to be loved. You need to know why they are the way they are... the history not just the easy stuff but the hard things also.
i find so much comfort in music
be obsessed with improving yourself
accepting the situation is the best way to move on
trusting people is quite traumatizing
