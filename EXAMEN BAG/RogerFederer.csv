We had a fun day in NYC as we unveiled my latest collaboration with JW Anderson x Uniqlo and launched the first 'Around the World with Roger Federer' event series. It was so nice to interact with all who came, especially with some inspiring kids on a tennis court that was beautifully designed by Kaws. 😁🌆🎾👌🏼
Everybody loves British summertime
